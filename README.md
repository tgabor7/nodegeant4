The webapplication provides a web interface for Geant4 simulations. The application only requires a browser with WebGL capabilities. The application is deployed at https://radsim.inf.elte.hu/ .

  

## User documentation
  

### 1. User interface

</figure>

  

The UI consists of the following parts:

- Sidebar for handling detectors and particle sources

- Canvas the simulation is rendered on

- Code editor

- Navigation bar

  
___
#### 1.1 Creating detectors

  

Detectors can be created by choosing the 'Add' option on the navigation bar. The shape of the detector can be of one of the predefined shapes (cube, cone, cylinder ... ) or the user can upload an .STL file. The material of the detector can be choosen from the Geant4 database, it contains both elements and compounds.

#### 1.2 Defining source

  

Particle sources can be created with particle guns and radioactive sources, both of them can be found in the 'Add' option on the navigation bar. You can define a particle guns position, the direction of the primary particle and its energy. Radioactive sources' materials can be choosen from the Geant4 database.
